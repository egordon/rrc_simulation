Real Robot Challenge Simulation
===============================

This repository is exclusively intended for participating
in the [simulation phase of the Real Robot Challenge](https://real-robot-challenge.com/simulation_phase).

For simulating the open-source version of the TriFinger robot, please use the 
repository linked on the official open-source [project website](https://sites.google.com/view/trifinger).


This repository contains a simulation, based on PyBullet, of the TriFinger robot
used in the Real Robot Challenge. In addition, it contains OpenAI gym
environments and evaluation scripts for the tasks of the simulation phase.

For more information on the challenge see:

- the [challenge website](https://real-robot-challenge.com)
- the [software
  documentation](https://people.tuebingen.mpg.de/felixwidmaier/realrobotchallenge/index.html)
